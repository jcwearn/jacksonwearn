            | Hi.  My name is Jackson. I am a Software Engineer for the Jobs UX and Services team at CareerBuilder.  I am a chronic tinkerer.  I read code, I write code, and I love expanding my technological arsenal.  I have a strong fondness for Node.js and Ruby, but I am always eager to try bleeding edge technologies.  Feel free to drop me a line if youâ€™re interested in learning about my work experience, or if you just want to chat.
